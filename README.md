# kitchen_aws_ec2
This repo contains code that will test if terraform creates an aws instance with ubuntu OS

# What is this repo for

This repo contains terraform code that will create an aws ec2 instance and will test if that instance has Ubuntu OS installed on it.

# Why use this repo

This repo is valuable since it shows hands on how to use kitchen test with terraform.

# How to use this repo

### Before using this code there are some prerequisites that need to be fulfilled.

* AWS Account
* AWS Access Key ID
* AWS Secret Key

  Put both AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key as environment variables for the shel you are using like so
  ```
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```
  check if they are now present by typing in `env` command
  
* An AWS Keypair

 Create a key pair in the portal  or follow this [instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-key-pair.html)
 
* Terraform installed

You can download Terraform from this [link](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

* Ruby >= 2.4, < 2.7

Ruby can be installed with `brew install ruby`

* Bundler installed

Bundler can be installed with `gem install bundler`

### Steps to use this code

* Download this repository to you local workstation

```
git clone git@github.com:yordanivh/kitchen_aws_ec2.git
```

* Change to the downloaded repo

```
cd kitchen_aws_ec2
```

* In the Gemfile you can see that we will use `kitchen-terraform` gem, there we need to download it for this environment with the following command

```
bundle install
```

* In the .kitchen.yml file you will see this config

```
key_files:
        - /Users/yhalachev/Downloads/yordan.pem
```
 you need to change the path with the one of your own key. That is to be used to be able to login via ssh on the EC2 instance.

* create a `file.tfvars` file to put in the values of the variables

```
touch testing.tfvars
```

* put the following infromation there

```
key_name = "Your key name"
region = "Region the key is located in"
ami = "ami-0fc20dd1da406780b"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

* Now we can perform the test. First step is to create the resource we wil test.

```
bundle exec kitchen converge
```

* You can expect the output of the command to look something like this.

```
